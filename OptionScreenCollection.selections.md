# OptionScreenCollection.selections property

Get the options that the user has selected for the current screen. Indices are zero-based, so if the user has selected the first option in the first group, `OptionScreenCollection.selections[0]` will be `0`.

```typescript
OptionScreenCollection.selections: number[]
```
