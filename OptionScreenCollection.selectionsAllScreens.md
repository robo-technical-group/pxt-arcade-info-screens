# OptionScreenCollection.selectionsAllScreens property

Get a collection of the options that the user has selected on all of the option screens in the collection. Indices are zero-based, so if the user has selected the first option in the first group on the first page, then `OptionScreenCollection.selectionsAllScreens[0][0]` will be `0`.

```typescript
OptionScreenCollection.selectionsAllScreens: number[][]
```
